# DarkTower

This repo was, at first, an attempt to recreate the game DarkTower (which was a game available on PDC consoles by VideoJet like the PDC100, PDC Vision or DDC100) from scratch.
However, I didn't had the time or skills to do that, but I found a way to play it with an emulator called MAME.

## Tutorial

* First step, you have to download the [MAME emulator](https://mamedev.org).
* Then, you have to download the dumped rom of the PDC100.
  * Slowly way through [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/download/mame-merged/mame-merged/) (search for "pdc100.zip").
  * Rapid way through the [repo](https://github.com/Maxcension/DarkTower/blob/master/pdc100.zip).
* Once the downloads are finished, install MAME and when it's done, copy/paste the pdc100.zip to the roms folder in the MAME folder (**don't unzip the file!**).
* Start MAME, select "available" in the left and then click ont "PDC100 - Pocket Dream (Anncia, US)".
* Enjoy! :)

The buttons on your keyboard are the arrows and ctrl/alt.
Also, before starting the PDC rom, you can select "configure options", go to "video option" and then turn on "HSLS" to improve quality.
