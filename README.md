Recreation of the game Dark Tower

## What's that?

Dark Tower was a game available in the console PDC-100, also called PDC Vision, by VideoJet.
It was a puzzle game I loved, so I decided to recreate it in Processing.
Considering the fact that i haven't the game except on my console (i tried to find a dump or anything else but there was nothing in internet), the graphics and the music of the game will not be the same as the original game, but I will try my best to do something as close as the original. The gameplay and the level design will be EXACTLY the same.
If you have or you know anything about this game, you can DM me on Twitter (@Maxcension) or send me an email (***REMOVED***).
